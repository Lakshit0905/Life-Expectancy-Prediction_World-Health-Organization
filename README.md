# Life Expectancy Prediction World Health Organization and Teams FIFA 2022 Machine Learning Models

we have used Machine Learning Regression Models to predict the life expectancy of people in various countries of the world using WHO data

Models used:
K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
Linear Regression
Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor
Ridge and Lasso Regression
Polynomial Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Support Vector Machines SVM (Linear, Kernel SVR - Linear, Poly, RBF)
Bagging and Pasting
Boosting - Adaboost, Gradient Boost
PCA for dimensionality reduction
